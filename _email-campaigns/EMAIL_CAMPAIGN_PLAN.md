## Email Template Structure

### Design Principles (Inspired by Brevo)
1. **Alternating Background Colors** - Use white and light colored backgrounds (e.g., #f8f9fa) to create visual separation between sections
2. **Clear Visual Hierarchy** - Each section should be distinct and scannable
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start with foundational concepts, then build to specific tasks
4. **Practical Tips** - Include actionable tips with checkmarks (✓) for easy scanning
5. **Support Accessibility** - Always include a "Need a hand?" section with support links
6. **Professional but Friendly Tone** - Approachable language that doesn't overwhelm

### Standard Sections (All Emails)
1. **Header** - Logo/branding, gradient background (optional)
2. **Section 1 (White background)** - Personal greeting, introduction, primary CTA
3. **Section 2 (Light background)** - "How it works" with step-by-step guide or visual reference
4. **Section 3 (White background)** - Tips, best practices, or additional information with checkmarks
5. **Section 4 (Light background)** - "Need a hand?" support section
6. **Footer** - Copyright, unsubscribe (`{{ unsubscribe }}`), social links, "View in browser" (`{{ mirror }}`)

### Visual Elements
- **Checkmarks (✓)** for tips and best practices
- **Numbered steps** for process guides
- **Clear CTAs** - Primary action button, secondary text links
- **Illustration references** - Mention visuals/animations that would be in the actual HTML
- **Color scheme** - Primary brand color (#0070f3 blue) for CTAs, alternating white/light backgrounds

### Brevo Template Variables

#### Contact Attributes (Campaigns & Automations)
Use these for personalization in all emails:

**Built-in Contact Attributes:**
- `{{ contact.FIRSTNAME }}` - User's first name
- `{{ contact.LASTNAME }}` - User's last name
- `{{ contact.EMAIL }}` - User's email address
- `{{ contact.COMPANY }}` - Company/organization name
- `{{ contact.CITY }}` - City
- `{{ contact.COUNTRY }}` - Country
- `{{ contact.STATE }}` - State/Province

**With Fallback (Recommended):**
- `{{ contact.FIRSTNAME | default: 'there' }}` - Safe greeting if name missing
- `{{ contact.COMPANY | default: 'your organization' }}` - Safe company reference

**Custom Contact Attributes (to be created in Brevo):**
- `{{ contact.organization_name }}` - DocRouter organization name (for registered users)
- `{{ contact.user_role }}` - User role (admin, user, etc.)
- `{{ contact.signup_date }}` - Account creation date
- `{{ contact.documents_uploaded }}` - Count of uploaded documents
- `{{ contact.prompts_created }}` - Count of created prompts
- `{{ contact.last_activity_date }}` - Last activity timestamp

#### Transactional Email Attributes (API/SMTP)
Use `{{ params.* }}` for dynamic data passed via API:

**For Welcome/Verification Emails:**
- `{{ params.verification_url }}` - Email verification link
- `{{ params.site_url }}` - Base URL of the site
- `{{ params.organization_name }}` - Organization name

**For Onboarding Emails:**
- `{{ params.site_url }}` - Base URL for CTAs
- `{{ params.document_count }}` - Number of documents uploaded (if applicable)
- `{{ params.prompt_count }}` - Number of prompts created (if applicable)
- `{{ params.dashboard_url }}` - Direct link to user dashboard

**For Prospect Emails:**
- `{{ params.site_url }}` - Base URL for CTAs
- `{{ params.signup_url }}` - Direct signup link
- `{{ params.demo_url }}` - Link to schedule demo

#### System Attributes (Mandatory)
- `{{ unsubscribe }}` - Unsubscribe link (required in footer)
- `{{ update_profile }}` - Manage preferences link
- `{{ mirror }}` - View in browser link

#### Sender Attributes
- `{{ sender.name }}` - Sender name
- `{{ sender.email }}` - Sender email
- `{{ sender.company }}` - Sender company
- `{{ sender.address }}` - Sender address

#### Conditional Logic (Advanced)
```html
{% if contact.FIRSTNAME %}
  Hi {{ contact.FIRSTNAME }},
{% else %}
  Hi there,
{% endif %}
```

```html
{% if contact.documents_uploaded > 0 %}
  We noticed you've uploaded {{ contact.documents_uploaded }} documents!
{% endif %}
```

### Recommended Attribute Usage by Email Type

**Onboarding Emails (Registered Users):**
- Greeting: `{{ contact.FIRSTNAME | default: 'there' }}`
- Organization: `{{ contact.organization_name | default: contact.COMPANY | default: 'your organization' }}`
- Dynamic data: Use `{{ params.* }}` for site URLs, counts, etc.

**Prospect Emails (Non-Registered):**
- Greeting: `{{ contact.FIRSTNAME | default: 'there' }}`
- Company: `{{ contact.COMPANY | default: 'your company' }}`
- Dynamic data: Use `{{ params.* }}` for signup URLs, demo links, etc.

## Implementation Notes

### Brevo Setup Requirements

**1. Create Custom Contact Attributes**
Before implementing the email campaigns, create these custom attributes in Brevo:
- Go to **Contacts → Attributes → Add Attribute**
- Create the following attributes:
  - `organization_name` (Text) - DocRouter organization name
  - `user_role` (Text) - User role (admin, user, etc.)
  - `signup_date` (Date) - Account creation date
  - `documents_uploaded` (Number) - Count of uploaded documents
  - `prompts_created` (Number) - Count of created prompts
  - `last_activity_date` (Date) - Last activity timestamp

**2. Sync Contact Data**
- When users register, sync their data to Brevo contacts
- Update custom attributes when users perform actions (upload docs, create prompts)
- Use Brevo API or webhooks to keep contact data in sync

**3. Transactional Email Setup**
- For transactional emails (welcome, verification), use Brevo SMTP/API
- Pass dynamic data via `params` object in API calls
- Example API payload structure:
  ```json
  {
    "to": [{ "email": "user@example.com" }],
    "params": {
      "verification_url": "https://docrouter.ai/auth/verify?token=...",
      "site_url": "https://docrouter.ai",
      "organization_name": "Acme Corp"
    }
  }
  ```

**4. Campaign vs Transactional**
- **Campaign emails** (onboarding sequence, prospect sequence): Use Brevo Campaigns/Automations with contact attributes
- **Transactional emails** (verification, password reset): Use Brevo SMTP/API with `params`

### Design Approach (Lessons from Brevo)
- **Start with foundation, not tasks:** Email 1 focuses on understanding the workflow before jumping into tasks
- **Alternating backgrounds:** Use white and light colored backgrounds (#f8f9fa or similar) to create visual separation
- **Scannable sections:** Each section should be distinct and easy to scan
- **Progressive disclosure:** Build knowledge progressively - foundation → basic tasks → advanced features
- **Practical tips with checkmarks:** Use ✓ symbols for actionable tips that are easy to scan
- **Support always accessible:** Include "Need a hand?" section in every email
- **Professional but friendly tone:** Approachable language that doesn't overwhelm

### Timing Considerations
- **Onboarding emails:** Send based on user actions (uploaded docs, created prompts) when possible, with time-based fallbacks
- **Prospect emails:** Time-based sequence, but pause if user registers
- **Respect user preferences:** Always include `{{ unsubscribe }}` link and honor opt-outs

### Personalization
- **Use Brevo contact attributes** for personalization:
  - Greeting: `{{ contact.FIRSTNAME | default: 'there' }}`
  - Organization: `{{ contact.organization_name | default: contact.COMPANY }}`
- **Use conditional logic** to personalize content based on user activity:
  - `{% if contact.documents_uploaded > 0 %}` - Reference actual uploads
  - `{% if contact.prompts_created > 0 %}` - Reference prompt creation
- **Use transactional params** for dynamic links and counts:
  - `{{ params.document_count }}` - Show actual document count
  - `{{ params.dashboard_url }}` - Direct links to specific pages
- **Track engagement** in Brevo and adjust sequence accordingly
- **For registered users:** Reference their actual activity using custom attributes

### A/B Testing Opportunities
- Subject lines
- CTA button text and placement
- Email length (short vs. detailed)
- Visual design elements

### Metrics to Track
- Open rates
- Click-through rates (CTAs)
- Conversion rates (sign-ups, document uploads, prompt creation)
- Unsubscribe rates
- Time to first action (upload, prompt creation)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Brevo custom attributes** (see Implementation Notes above)
2. **Create email templates** for each email in the sequence using Brevo attribute syntax
3. **Set up Brevo automation workflows** for campaign emails (onboarding & prospect sequences)
4. **Integrate Brevo API/SMTP** for transactional emails (verification, password reset)
5. **Sync contact data** from DocRouter to Brevo (on registration, activity updates)
6. **Set up email triggers** in the application to update Brevo contact attributes
7. **Test email delivery** across different email clients
8. **Monitor and optimize** using Brevo analytics (open rates, click rates, conversions)
