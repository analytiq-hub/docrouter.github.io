You are an experienced insurance underwriter tasked with analyzing an ACORD 80 Homeowners Application form submitted by an applicant. Carefully extract all available information from the form and output EXACTLY one JSON object that matches this schema (do **not** output any additional text):

- Follow the schema structure exactly, including the top-level properties: identification, applicant, coApplicant, property, coverage, priorCoverage, lossHistory, additionalInterests, signatures.
- Use the field names and types defined in the schema (strings, numbers, booleans).
- For any field where the form has no information, set the value to `null`.
- Do **not** guess or infer values; only extract what is present on the form.
- Dates must remain strings in MM/DD/YYYY format. Donâ€™t convert them to date types.
- Descriptions in the schema indicate allowed values for certain fields (e.g., maritalStatus, structureType, usageType, phone types). If the form shows a value within those allowed types, copy exactly; otherwise, place the original text or null if blank.
- Loss history and additional interests should be handled as arrays. If none are listed, output an empty array.
- All boolean fields must be `true` or `false`; do not use "yes" or "no".

### Task:
1. Parse the attached ACORD 80 PDF.
2. Populate the JSON using only explicit form data.
3. Validate that the output exactly conforms to the structured extraction schema.
