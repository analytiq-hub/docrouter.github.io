*AI-powered document processing platform that transforms unstructured documents into actionable data*

## The Challenge

Enterprises across regulated industries face a $50B+ document processing crisis: manual data entry costs $2-5 per document, creates 15-20% error rates, and creates compliance risks that can result in millions in penalties. Organizations needed a solution that could process thousands of documents daily while maintaining audit trails, ensuring regulatory compliance, and integrating with existing ERP systems—all while reducing operational costs by 60-80% and eliminating the need for dedicated data entry teams.

## The Solution

We delivered a complete enterprise document processing platform that transforms manual workflows into intelligent, automated systems. DocRouter.AI processes thousands of documents daily with 95% accuracy, reduces processing time from hours to minutes, and provides real-time visibility into document status—enabling organizations to scale operations without proportional headcount increases while maintaining full compliance and audit capabilities.
