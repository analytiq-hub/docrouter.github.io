*AI-powered supply chain document processing that transforms trade documents and security compliance workflows*

## The Challenge

Global supply chain operations face critical operational challenges processing vast amounts of complex documentation that requires high accuracy and speed. Organizations needed automated solutions to handle:

- **Trade Documentation**: Bills of lading, commodity contracts, commodity sampling certificates, and letters of credit
- **Security Compliance**: Security profiles, standard operating procedures, and risk analysis documents

Manual processing of these documents created operational bottlenecks, increased error rates, and made compliance tracking difficult across global operations—requiring an intelligent solution that could maintain accuracy while dramatically improving processing speed.

## The Solution

We delivered two specialized document processing systems tailored to different aspects of supply chain management, each designed to handle the unique requirements of trade documentation and security compliance while maintaining the accuracy and speed needed for global operations.
