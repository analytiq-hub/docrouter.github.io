## Setting Up Your Company Website

The fastest way to get started is by using our reference implementation at [analytiqhub.com](https://analytiqhub.com/) as your starting point. This site demonstrates all the Analytiq Pages features in action and serves as a complete template for your company website. You'll clone this proven foundation and customize it with your branding, content, and specific requirements.

Let's walk through creating a professional company website using the Analytiq Pages approach.

### Step 1: Repository Setup

Start by forking the Analytiq Pages reference implementation:

1. **Fork the repository**: Go to [https://github.com/analytiq-hub/analytiq-hub.github.io](https://github.com/analytiq-hub/analytiq-hub.github.io) and click "Fork"
2. **Rename your fork**: In your forked repository settings, rename it to `your-company.github.io`
3. **Clone for local development**:

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/your-company/your-company.github.io.git
cd your-company.github.io
```

### Step 2: Customize for Your Company

Replace all Analytiq Hub references with your company information:

**Key files to update:**

1. **`_config.yml`** - Site configuration:
```yaml
title: Your Company Name
email: contact@yourcompany.com
description: Your company description
baseurl: ""
url: "http://your-company.github.io"
github_username: yourcompany
```

2. **`index.md`** - Homepage content
3. **`about.md`** - Company information  
4. **`_posts/`** - Replace sample blog posts with your content
5. **`assets/images/`** - Replace logos and images
6. **`CNAME`** - Update with your custom domain (if using one)

**GitHub Pages setup:**
- Go to your repository Settings â†’ Pages
- Set source to "Deploy from a branch" â†’ main
- Add custom domain if you have one

The forked template already includes Tailwind CSS configuration, so your site is ready to run locally with `make dev` or deploy immediately to GitHub Pages.

### Step 3: Local Development Setup

Install [local development prerequisites](https://analytiqhub.com/docs/local_development) and start developing locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Start development server
make dev
```

For complete setup instructions including Ruby, Bundler, and troubleshooting, see the full [Local Development Setup guide](https://analytiqhub.com/docs/local_development).

Point your web browser to the local development server at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). 

After editing files in the sandbox, manually or with Claude Code, Cursor or the preferred AI editor, they are automatically refreshed on the development server. 
* Changes to the menu or the footing require a restart of the local development server.
* When later the github pages pipeline is setup, a push of local changes will trigger the web site update at https://your-company.github.io

### Step 4: Essential Company Pages

Update the core pages with your company information:
- **`index.md`** - Homepage with compelling hero section and company value proposition
- **`about.md`** - Company story, team information, and mission
- **`contact.md`** - Contact information and inquiry forms

### Step 5: Header and Footer Customization

Start by configuring your site navigation in **`_config.yml`**:

```yaml
# Header navigation menu
header_pages:
  - title: "Services"
    url: "#"
    children:
      - title: "Consulting"
        url: "/consulting"
      - title: "Development"
        url: "/development"
  - title: "Case Studies"
    url: "/case-studies"
  - title: "Blog"
    url: "/blog"
  - title: "About"
    url: "/about"
  - title: "Contact"
    url: "/contact"
    button_style: "solid"

# Footer sitemap
site_map:
  - title: "Services"
    links:
      - title: "Consulting"
        url: "/consulting"
      - title: "Case Studies"
        url: "/case-studies"
  - title: "Company"
    links:
      - title: "About"
        url: "/about"
      - title: "Contact"
        url: "/contact"
```

Then customize the visual elements:
- **`_includes/custom-header.html`** - Company logo, announcements, search
- **`_includes/custom-footer.html`** - Contact info, social links, legal pages

### Step 6: Blog Setup

Jekyll's blog functionality is ready out of the box:
- Create posts in `_posts/` using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`
- Posts automatically appear on your homepage and `/blog` page
- Use front matter to set title, author, categories, and featured images

### Step 7: Case Studies

Showcase your work with detailed case studies:
- Add case studies to the `_case_studies/` collection
- Use the case study template for consistent formatting
- Include client results, project images, and key outcomes

### Step 8: (Advanced) Custom Components

The template includes Tailwind-powered components for:
- Call-to-action sections
- Team member profiles  
- Service feature cards
- Client testimonials

Your AI editor can help create custom components by combining Jekyll's liquid templating with Tailwind's utility classes.

### Step 9: (Advanced) Custom Layouts

Create specialized page layouts by extending the base templates:
- **`_layouts/landing.html`** - For marketing campaigns and product launches
- **`_layouts/portfolio.html`** - Showcase projects with image galleries
- **`_layouts/team.html`** - Team member profiles with bios and photos

Copy existing layouts as starting points and modify with your specific content structure and Tailwind styling.

## Deployment and Domain Setup

### GitHub Pages Configuration

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
2. **Set source** to "Deploy from a branch" â†’ main
3. **Custom domain**: Add your company domain in settings

### Domain Configuration

**DNS Setup:**
```
# For apex domain (company.com)
A record: 185.199.108.153
A record: 185.199.109.153
A record: 185.199.110.153
A record: 185.199.111.153

# For www subdomain
CNAME record: your-company.github.io
```

**CNAME File:**
```bash
echo "your-company.com" > CNAME
```
